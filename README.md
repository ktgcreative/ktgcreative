# Hello, I'm Kyle Grattan! 👋

## About Me
👨‍💻 I'm a Machine Learning & Web Development graduate based in Queenstown, New Zealand, currently working on projects focused on **adventure tourism operations** and **Next.js optimisations**.  
🌊 As a riverboarding guide, I'm passionate about adventure and safety, which directly inspires my work in software solutions for high-stakes industries.  
🥁 Outside of coding and river guiding, I’m also a drummer, always chasing rhythm and creativity in everything I do.  
📈 Driven by continuous learning, teamwork, and developing impactful tools that solve real-world problems.

## My First Python Package
- 🌐 [PivotPal](https://www.pythonpivotpal.com) - a versatile tool for data analysis.
